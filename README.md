# Matlab-class-project
Matlab code to simulate the vibration of a rotating unbalance system.

Question: Simulate the vibration of rotating unbalance system with superimposing the motion parameters in the video.

Answer Formulation:
A reference point in the mass system has taken and whose movement, displacement, velocity and acceleration has plotted with time in a graphical plot. The values to the variables are arbitrarily taken in order to plot a good solution.
